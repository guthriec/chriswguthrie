[kitpicks.com](kitpicks.com) is up and running!

It's not much to look at yet. It's just a landing page. I set it up as an Astro site on Vercel, which might be overkill, but the setup was super super easy.

Doing the logo wasn't too bad (some tracing may have been involved to make up for a general lack of artistic talent on my behalf) and it turned out great. I gave AI a shot at helping me with the logo, and this is what Claude came up with: <img src='/images/kitpicks-logo.svg' alt="Claude's Artwork" width=400px>

So I gave up on the AI approach pretty quickly.

Next up is a first iteration on the user interface...
