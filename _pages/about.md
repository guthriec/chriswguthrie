ðŸ‘‹ My name is Chris Guthrie. I'm currently pursuing a research-based Computer Science Master's at the University of Colorado in Boulder (my hometown!). I'm also developing a privacy-first RSS recommendation feed called Kitpicks -- link coming soon!

## CV in Brief

Stanford Undergrad > Travel > App Development Projects (Mobile and Web) > Google > CU Boulder

## Research Interests

In general, I'm interested in algorithms which enable computational agents (robots, drones, AI assistants...) to continually learn, adapt, and pursue pro-social goals in "big worlds."

### Theory

- Online learning and optimization
- Bandits and exploration algorithms
- Search/planning algorithms in games and decision processes

One question I'm currently thinking about: How suboptimal is it to model the world as adversarial when it's actually stochastic/i.i.d.?

### Practical Techniques

- Online fine-tuning of deep models
- "Networks of agents" for heterogeneous systems and decentralized decision-making
- LLMs as foundation models, embedding models, and otherwise "components" of decision-making systems
